A minimalist NodeJS client for [singyeong](https://github.com/queer/singyeong) written in TypeScript. Requires Node 18+

This client provides very little abstractions over the singyeong connection and protocol, while still providing QoL
helpers and a user-friendly API.

The small amount of abstractions makes it plugin-friendly: it can deal with arbitrary events and routes easily.

> **Warning**: singyeong is alpha software, so is this client. Because breaking changes may happen at any time in
> singyeong, it means the library may also receive breaking changes that will reflect the upstream changes.
